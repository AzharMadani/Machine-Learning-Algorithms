# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
I applied all the Machine Learning Algorithms including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost on different datasets.
This gave me a in depth understanding of how does a model the target value (y).
I have also tried the mathematical approach whule solving applying these models.
